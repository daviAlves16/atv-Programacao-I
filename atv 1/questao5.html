    <h1>React Blog</h1>
    <p>This blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. 
        Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, 
        will be posted here first. You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, 
        but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read this blog.

    <h2>React Canaries: Enabling Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta</h2>
    <p>We’d like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as 
        soon as their design is close to final, before they’re released in a stable version—similar 
        to how Meta has long used bleeding-edge versions of React internally. We are introducing a 
        new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like 
        frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.
    </p>

    <h2>React Server Components</h2>
    <p>React Server Components (or RSC) is a new application architecture designed by the React team.
        We’ve first shared our research on RSC in an introductory talk and an RFC. To recap them, 
        we are introducing a new kind of component—Server Components—that run ahead of time and are 
        excluded from your JavaScript bundle. Server Components can run during the build, letting 
        you read from the filesystem or fetch static content. They can also run on the server, 
        letting you access your data layer without having to build an API. 
        You can pass data by props from Server Components to the interactive Client Components 
        in the browser. RSC combines the simple “request/response” mental model of server-centric 
        Multi-Page Apps with the seamless interactivity of client-centric Single-Page Apps, 
        giving you the best of both worlds. Since our last update, we have merged the React 
        Server Components RFC to ratify the proposal.
    </p>
